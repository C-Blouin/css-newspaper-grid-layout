# css-newspaper-grid-layout

A complicated CSS layout that depicts the look and feel of an old newspaper using modern CSS techniques through grid and flexbox. Built with responsive design in mind and dynamically adjusts the layout to account for the end-user device width. 

This project was built during my second semester at Georgian College throughout my Interface Design with CSS course.
